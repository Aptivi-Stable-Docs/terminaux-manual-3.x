# â›± Color Model Conversions

Terminaux provides several color models that you can convert from/to using the `Color` instance. You can use the RGB property from it to be able to start converting your color to another color model using the appropriate conversion tools for your target unit. The following conversion tools are available:

* `CmyConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to CMY
* `CmykConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to CMYK
* `HslConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to HSL
* `HsvConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to HSV
* `RgbConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to RGB
* `RybConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to RYB
* `YiqConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to YIQ
* `YuvConversionTools`: Converts your color model instance to YUV

These classes were made to facilitate the color model conversion, such as from RGB to CMY, from CMY to HSL, from HSL to RYB, and so on. This means that it's easier than before.

Color models also contain their normalized properties. Some of these models have the `Normalized` (floating point numbers) variants of the components, while some others have the `Whole` (integers) variants.

To convert your source color model, you first need to select the conversion tools according to the color model that you want to convert the source model to (a.k.a. the target color model). For example, if you want to convert RGB to HSV, you can use the `HsvConversionTools` and call the function, `ConvertFrom(RedGreenBlue)`, to run the conversion.

Here's how the conversion is run:

{% code title="Somewhere in your program..." lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
var color = new Color(128, 255, 0);
var hsv = HsvConversionTools.ConvertFrom(color.RGB);
```
{% endcode %}

The program above converts the color that has the RGB value of `128, 255, 0` to its representation in Hue, Saturation, and Value color model. You can then consult the target's properties to see the resulting values, such as the hue, saturation, and the value variables in both the fractional form `[0.00, 1.00]` and the complete form `[0, 100]`.
